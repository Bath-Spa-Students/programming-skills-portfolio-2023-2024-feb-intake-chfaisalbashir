#dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
#someone else to invite.

#the name of the guest who can’t make it.
#•Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of
# the new person you are inviting.
#•Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.
#invitation some people to dinner.
