#You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner,
#and you have space for only two guests.
#•Start with your program from Exercise 3-5. Add a new line that prints a message saying
#that you can invite only two people for dinner.
#•Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list.
#Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re
#sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
#•Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
#•Use del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list
#to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
