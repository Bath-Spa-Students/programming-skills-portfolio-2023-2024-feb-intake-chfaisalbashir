#A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, 
#let’s call it a glossary.
#* Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. 
#Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store 
#their meanings as values.
#* Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the 
#word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print 
#the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. 
#Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between 
#each word-meaning pair in your output.
