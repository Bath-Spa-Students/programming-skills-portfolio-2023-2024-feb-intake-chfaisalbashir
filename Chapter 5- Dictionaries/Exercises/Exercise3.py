#Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from Exercise 6-3 (page 99)
#by replacing your series of print()

#calls with a loop that runs through the dictionary’s keys and values. When you’re sure 
#that your loop works, add five more Python terms 

#to your glossary.When you run your program again, these new words and meanings should
#automatically be included in the output.
